# Lab-11

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Going through a laundry list of stuff.
I love laundry:

- [ ] quota issues - my bad
- [ ] you might need to look into the Picture source
- [ ] assignment 5 late policy
- [ ] looking at CSV files to guide your coding
- [ ] info about the Gauntlet

## QUOTA ISSUES

So there is a hidden folder in many of the assignment directories that you need to get rid of, because each one has a large number of files and folders that are counting against your quota on INS.

To find out where these folders are located, go to your home directory on INS and enter in the following command: `find . -name .git`

You then need to delete each of these .git folders. (If you can't remember how to do that, go back and look at the [Linux Command Reference](https://bit.ly/mru-1501-linux-ref) back in Lab-00.)

## PICTURE SOURCE

If you're working on the **AsciiArt** class, you should carefully read the [notes.for.Picture.java.md].

## YOUR (LAST!) SKILL DRILL

The following is due by 9AM on December 4th:
